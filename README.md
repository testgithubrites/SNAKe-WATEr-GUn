# SNAKe-WATEr-GUn
In this project I build up snake water gun game using python.
game is played between computer and you.
random module is used for generating random numbers.
Conditional statments like if elif and else are used according to the rules of this game.
That are

2. from snake and gun -player who chose gun wins
3. from  gun and water - player who chose gun wins
